  # Description  
  A Progressive Web Application to satisfy your budget management needs!
  # Installation  
  Please fork the repository
  # Usage
  Not sure about everyone else, but I am terrible with money management. I tend to spend too much and save too little. Keeping track of all of my purchases was a paint, but now we can store deposits and withdrawals with the budget tracker! Just input a label for your transaction, the amount of money of the transaction (for now it is an integer) and either add or subtract funds. It's as simple as that! There is also a visual indicator to show your net saving or spending throughout your time using the Budget Tracker. Download the application and go offline, we will update your information as soon as we can find an internet connection :)
